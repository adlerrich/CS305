# CS305
The client, Artimes Financial, is a financial institution attempting to build an online platform to facilitate customer interactions.
I beleive I did well in identifying potential vulnerablities and mitigating any concerns that were within my scope while offering advice on matters outside of it.
The vulnerability report mainly identified how out of date everything was and emphasized the importance of continous system updates.
When refactoring the code, I was careful to use best practices, ensure I left no vulnerablilites within intakes for expected inputs and error logging, and double checked my work by running another dependency after the refactor to ensure I hadn't added any vulnerabilities.
The maven dependency check and in-built tools in Eclipse were invaluable in completing this assignment.
This work shows my ability to accurately review a small codebase to ensure that security standards are met.
